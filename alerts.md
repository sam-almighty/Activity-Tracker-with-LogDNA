# Configuring alerts
{: #alerts}

Through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI, you can apply search queries to define the events that are displayed through a custom view. Then, you can attach an alert to that view to be notified when a condition occurs. You can attach one or more alerts to a view. You can define multiple notification channels for an alert. You can mute alerts. You can detach alerts from a view.

## Prerequisites
{: #alerts_prereqs}

* [Learn more about alerts](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-monitor_events#mon_alerts).

* **You must have a paid service plan** for the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service. [Learn more](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-service_plan#service_plan).

* Check that your user ID has permissions to launch the web UI and view events. The following table lists the minimum roles that a user must have to be able to launch the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI, and view, search, and filter events:

| Role                      | Permission granted            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Platform role: `Viewer`     | Allows the user to view the list of service instances in the Observability dashboard. |
| Service role: `Reader`      | Allows the user to launch the web UI and view events in the web UI.  |
