# Cloud services
{: #cloud_services}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to monitor user-initiated activities that change the state of any of the following services in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Compute VMware solution services
{: #vmware_solutions}

With {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full_notm}}, you can quickly and seamlessly integrate or migrate your on-premises VMware workloads to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using the scalable, secure, and high-performance {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure and the industry-leading VMware hybrid virtualization technology. You can easily deploy your VMware virtual environments and manage the infrastructure resources on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. At the same time, you can still use your familiar native VMware product console to manage the VMware workloads. [Learn more](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmware-solutions-prod_overview).
