# IAM events
{: #at_events_iam}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service to track how users and applications interact with the {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 
{:shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. To get started monitoring your user's actions, see [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started#getting-started). 

An initiator can be a user, a service, or an application.
